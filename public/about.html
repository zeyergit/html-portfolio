<h1>Have a little looksee over here over 'der</h1>

<p>Mammy n' Pappy well dey was always talkin' bout how 
  I was a gonna be deh next prezident and the like. So I 
  tried my hardest at the schoolhouse 'en I learnt to read
  real good now. And den dey sent me to college!

<p>But den woke'ism spread through the country and everything
  just turned to shit over night. There was criminals everywhere
  'specially in the government! So I got me back to the farm 
  'en I a started a ploughin' and a shearin' en that's what 
  I do'z today.
